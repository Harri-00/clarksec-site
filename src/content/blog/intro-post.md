# Welcome to ClarkSec

Hey I’m Harrison. I’ve been working in IT for a bit, and I’m currently studying cybersecurity while building out my skills through labs, writeups, and projects.

This blog is where I’ll be posting walkthroughs (HTB, LetsDefend), tool spotlights, CVE breakdowns, and random homelab stuff I’m working on. It’s a mix of notes, learning, and showing what I know as I keep growing in the field.

Appreciate you checking it out.
